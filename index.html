                <p class="text-light-gray opacity-70 text-sm font-normal tracking-wide leading-5">"I was an EMT for many years before i joined the bootcamp. I've been looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free into course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing the course, i've successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup."</p>
