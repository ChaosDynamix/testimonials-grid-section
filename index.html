I've been looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free into course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing the course, i've successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup."</p>

                <p class="text-very-dark-grayish-blue opacity-70 text-sm font-normal tracking-wide leading-5">"Before joining the bootcamp, i've never written a line of code. I needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who an only say wonderful things about the program. the entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and i never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, i've often referred to it during interviews as an example of my development experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend!"</p>
